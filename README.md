# odin-recipes
//A first venture into HTML5 Framework (may revisit for CSS)

//JS_Merlin@ TheOdinProject Username.
//CaffeineCrutch@ github.   To follow my programming.

//  This project is intended to be an introduction into HTLM5 web design.
//  At some point, this project will be 'dressed' with CCS to be less brutalist.

// Project Basics Summary:


//--ITERATION 1 - INITIAL STRUCTURE--

    //Create the index.html file.
    //Dress HTML file with boiler plate and h1 heading "Odin Recipes" in the body.

//--ITERATION 2 - RECIPE PAGE--

    //Create new directory within the 'odin-recipes' directory and name it 'recipes'.
    //Create a html file within recipes directory and name it after its recipe e.g Spaghetti.html
    //for now, include a h1 heading with the recipes name as its content.
    //back in the index.html file , add a link to the recipe page
    //the text of the link should be the recipe name.

//--ITERATION 3 - RECIPE PAGE CONTENT--

    //an image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
    //Under the imagine, it should have an appropriately sized 'Description'
    //followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
    //under description add an "ingrediants heading followed by an unordered list.
    //Finally under the ingredients list add a "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list.

//--ITERATION 4 - ADD MORE RECIPES--

    //Add two more recipes that follow an identical page structure to the first recipe.
    //Link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links
    //in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.
    // REF CODE BY ME , FOR ME- .
